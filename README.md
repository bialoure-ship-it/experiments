## 💬 Example Interaction

**User:**  
Evaluate whether we should expand our embedded lending product into Spain.

**Agent:**  
**TL;DR**  
Spain is attractive due to strong SME demand and favorable PSD2 alignment, but competitive intensity requires a partner-led entry to maintain capital efficiency.

**Strategic Framing**  
Spain represents a €4.2B embedded lending opportunity driven by SME financing gaps and accelerating fintech adoption.

**Market Dynamics**  
- Regulatory alignment with PSD2 reduces compliance lift.  
- High SME digital adoption (68%) increases distribution efficiency.  
- Competitive landscape includes 3 major incumbents with moderate differentiation.

**Commercial Implications**  
- Expected CAC 12–18% lower than France due to partner distribution.  
- Payback period estimated at 7–9 months under conservative assumptions.  
- Margin pressure likely without differentiated underwriting.

**Risks & Mitigation**  
- **Risk:** Competitive response from incumbent lenders  
  **Mitigation:** Enter via exclusive vertical partnerships  
- **Risk:** Underwriting model portability  
  **Mitigation:** Local data partnerships + phased rollout  

**Recommended Next Actions**  
1. Initiate partner scouting with top 5 SME platforms.  
2. Run underwriting portability test using Spanish credit bureau data.  
3. Build regulatory checklist for CNMV engagement.
